    Dell EMC VxFlex OS has been rebranded to PowerFlex. The drivers
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.vxflexos.driver.VxFlexOSDriver``
    will now be updated to
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.powerflex.driver.PowerFlexDriver``
    in cinder.conf. Driver configuration options that start with ``vxflexos``
    should also be updated to ``powerflex``. Existing vxFlex OS configuration
    options will continue to work but will be removed in the W release.
    The previously deprecated driver
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.scaleio.driver.ScaleIODriver``
    and the corresponding sio options will now be removed.
    Online documentation will also change to reflect these changes.
